The graphics system for Virtual Nightmare is a 2bpp 320x200 screen at a
user-defined location, allowing for double buffering. Pixels go from left
to right, starting at the high bit of each word.

Graphics interrupts:

16 show 320x200 2bpp screen at r1
17 get current key pressed into r1
18 get timer value (incremented every ms) into r1
19 set timer value to r1
